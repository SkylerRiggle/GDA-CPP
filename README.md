# OU GDA C++ Workshop

## Overview

Welcome to the repository for the Game Developers Association at the University of Oklahoma's C++ Beginner Workshop! This project is designed to introduce newcomers to the world of low-level development in C++, no matter their level of experience. We hope you enjoy, and please feel free to offer us any feedback on what we can improve!

**Repository Branches:**
- **main**: *A clean project with a simple "Hello World!" application to make sure everything is setup.*
- **Final**: *The final result you will create if you follow the entirety of this workshop.*

## Compilation
To make the process of compiling your first C++ program less painful, we've prepared a simple application that will handle this for you.

To run this application, simply execute the following command:

```command
.\Compile.exe [OS_FLAG] [APP_NAME]
```

- OS_FLAG
    - This flag is a number indicating what operating system you are using.
    - 0 = Windows
    - 1 = MacOS
    - 2 = Linux
- APP_NAME
    - This is an optional paramter that specifies the name of the executable created by compiling your program.

***NOTE**: This setup may not work for your other C++ projects, and is designed to work with this specific workshop / file structure.*
